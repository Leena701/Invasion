# Emergency instructions for surviving an Alien Invasion
*** 
*Please read and follow instructions carefully.*

**The fate of the world is in your hands! Aliens are known for their fear of small flashing lights** (we should probably look into that) **so itâ€™s down to you to scare them away!**

## 1. Using a jumper wire, connect the five-volt pin to the first positive line on the breadboard.

## 3. Use the resistor to connect the switch to the five-volt row on the breadboard, placing one end next to the switch and the other on the powerline.

It's as easy as that! Good luck, it's down to you to save the whole world- no pressure.

## *Conclusion*

Often the world of computing seems daunting stopping people from exploring it further. I wanted to create a fun series of illustrations that could be appreciated and understood by any age or audience to introduce them to physical computing in a way that is humourous and enlightning. There's no need to feel alienated within this new world and as the instructions progress and you feel more comfortable you'll find the little alien of doubt is gone for good.
